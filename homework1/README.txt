1) Students: Mustafa Ghanim (NetID: mustafaghanim), Hasan Umut Suluhan (NetID: suluhan)  
2) Xilinx synthesis tool version: Vivado v2022.2 (64-bit) (default synthesis strategy, only the flatten_hierarchy option is set to 'none')
3) For the actual critical path delay we run the synthesis tool in Vivado, generate the 'max' timing summary report of the unconstrained paths,
and the we select the path with the largest total delay among the listed paths. 
For the estimated critical path delay of each implemented netlist, we select the path that has the largest sum of the datapath components total delay that it includes.
However, we only consider the critical paths that are executed from input to output within one clock cycle (a registered output can be included into the cricial path)
Estimated critical path delay calculation is done manually based on each netlist circuit's schematic that is generated by Vivado tool.
